                        <h5>What is Apartment Locating?</h5> Apartment locating is a value-added service where a Professional Real Estate Agent learns about your wants and needs and performs a personalized apartment search on your behalf. This saves you the hassle of making a lot of calls, saves you money on long-distance calls if moving from out of the Phoenix area, and makes your relocation experience hassle-free. By allowing Valley King Properties to do the work for you, a professional, whose only job is finding people their new home, is working to make sure you make an informed rental decision. This means you are pre-qualified to meet the rental criteria; your credit, employment, and rental history as well as minimum income requirements. In addition, we learn about your lifestyle and the amenities that are important to you in a home. This saves you TIME and GAS running from place to place seeing apartments that don't meet your needs. Best of all, our service is free of charge to you and quite possibly will save you money. We are in constant contact with thousands of rentals, therefore we know what is available and what specials there are.
